# CMSC 312 Operating System Simulator

## Project Topic

Implementation of an operating system simulator

## Requirements

* simulate the loading and execution of programs
* implement classes simulating software and hardware
* implement scheduling method
* apply relations among programs and system components
* control memory and its adjustment
* create GUI for monitoring and testing the system
* implement a series of operating system commands
* create a log with details of executed operations

## Program File Generation

To generate some more random program files, simply open up `scripts/build_programs.html` in a web browser.

## Commands

* load <program name> - Load the specified program into the simulation.
* exe <number of cycles> - Run the simulator for the given number of cycles.
* exe - Run the simulator continuously. You can use "exe 0" to pause the simulation.
