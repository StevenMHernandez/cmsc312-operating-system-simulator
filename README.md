## Developer Notes

### Program File Generation

To generate some more random program files, simply open up `scripts/build_programs.html` in a web browser.

### JAR File Generation

To rebuild `.jar`; in Intellij, `Build > Build Artifacts > Build`

It might be required that you first setup some settings.
`File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Artifacts > + > JAR > From module with dependencies`
Then you may have to set the output path to the root directory of this project.
